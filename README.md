# ParmaStack

## Compilation - Important
ParmaStack needs some binaries (apache, php, mongodb) in order to compile.  
These can be obtained [here](https://github.com/downloads/synthomat/ParmaStack/Unix.zip).

After downloading, unpack the zip-file in the root folder of the project.

## Usage
After launching ParmaStack, simple click the two buttons to start  
Apache, respectively MongoDB.

Apache can be accessed by browsing to http://localhost:8080/  
MongoDB starts an own webinterface at http://localhost:28017/

Have fun!
